# Antarctic-Food-Optimisation

<h1>Optimising remote field station food supplies for the British Antarctic Survey</h1>

Optimising logistics operations has a crucial impact on the overall carbon emissions entailed when 
planning a science campaign in Antarctica. One important problem is the planning of the food 
supply to feed a science team based at one of the remote Antarctic field stations over a season. 
The objective is to minimize food and plastic waste, as well as financial cost and the carbon 
emissions involved in transportation and storage of the foods. This must be done in the context of 
a variety of constraints, eg: daily food must meet nutritional requirements, and must be satisfying 
and enjoyable. It should satisfy any individual dietary restrictions, and meet as many of the stated 
preferences as possible. These requirements can all be expressed as constraints with an objective 
to be optimized. For example, food and inorganic waste should be minimized. The carbon costs of 
storing and transporting food, as well as the costs of the food itself, should also be minimized. 

The aim of this project is to construct a constraint program to solve this problem. The program 
should scale to a typical sized instance, eg: about 60 people over a 3-month season. Certain fixed 
resupply dates can be assumed, and the food purchasing strategy should be chosen to exploit 
these dates.
