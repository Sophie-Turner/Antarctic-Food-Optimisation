# Antarctic-Food-Optimisation

<h1>Optimising remote field station food supplies for the British Antarctic Survey</h1>

Optimising logistics operations has a crucial impact on the overall carbon emissions entailed when 
planning a science campaign in Antarctica. One important problem is the planning of the food 
supply to feed a science team based at one of the remote Antarctic field stations over a season. 
The objective is to minimise waste, financial cost and the carbon 
emissions associated with the foods. This is done in the context of 
a variety of constraints. The daily menu meets nutritional requirements, is satisfying 
and enjoyable and satisfies individual dietary restrictions. These requirements are expressed as constraints with an objective 
to be optimised.  

The aim of this project is to construct a constraint program to solve this problem. The program 
scales to instances of about 160 people over 20 days, or 25 people over 4 months. The food purchasing strategy is chosen according to availability of fresh foods brought by air.
