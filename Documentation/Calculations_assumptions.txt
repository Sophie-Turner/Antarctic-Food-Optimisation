SDA from UK

ship has 1440 m3 max food capacity (total storage capacity minus fuel storage) 

100g of dired pasta is
11cm x 6cm x 5cm = 330 cm3 = 0.00033 m3

1440 / 0.00033 = 4363636
The ship can carry about 4363636 x 100g portions of food

ship fuel costs £20,000 per day
= 2,000,000p 

voyage takes 20 days

distance from uk to rothera via falklands = 14,581 km

mixed cargo ship causes 13 g CO2e per ton of cargo per km travelled
= 0.0013 kg CO2e per 100g per km
x 14,581 km = 18.96 g CO2e = 0.018 kg CO2e

cost of moving 100g food = (2,000,000p x 20) / 4363636
= 9p 
emissions of moving 100g food = 0.01896 kg CO2e
considering only 1-way journey (not the return journey)


TWIN OTTER for Falkands

distance from Stanley, Falklands to Rothera = 1873 km = 1164 mi

travels 1.27 km per kg of fuel
but idk how much fuel is required for takeoff so didn't include that yet

aviation fuel currently costs 61p per kg

Twin Otter is designed to carry 20 people
but BAS ones carry 5 people
Assume max food capacity of Twin Otter is equivalent to 15 people
Average British man in clothes and shoes weighs 84 kg
84kg x 15 = 1260 kg
Twin Otter can carry max 12600 x 100g portions of food

requires = 1873km / 1.27km per kg = 1475 kg of fuel
which costs 1475kg x 61p = 89975p = £899.75
and causes ghg emissions of 1475kg x 3.15 = 4646 kg CO2eq

cost of moving 100g food = 89975p / 12600 = 7p
emissions of moving 100g food = 4646 kg / 12600 = 0.369 kg CO2eq
considering only 1-way journey (not the return journey)
but probably more due to takeoff
